 ## App Exercise - Mathematical Topics
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a math tutoring app.
 
 Suppose your app contains a list of different subjects that can be tracked. You want to display each item in the list to the user. Use a for-in loop to loop through `topics` below and print each subject. (.5 points)
 */
let topics: [String] = ["Algebra 1", "Geometry", "Algebra 2", "Math Analysis", "Calculus", "Prob & Stats"]


/*:
 Now suppose your app uses a dictionary to keep track of your average score for each of the topics in `topics`. The keys correspond to the topics listed above, and the values correspond to the average score that you acheived. Loop through `averageScores` below, printing statements telling the user his/her averages during each topic. (.5 points)

var averageScores: [String: Int] = ["Algebra 1": 85, "Geometry": 93, "Algebra 2": 88, "Math Analysis": 82, "Calculus": 91, "Prob & Stats": 93]
