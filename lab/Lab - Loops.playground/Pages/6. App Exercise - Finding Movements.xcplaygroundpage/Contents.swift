 ## App Exercise - Finding areas to improve
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a mathematical tutoring app.


 You decide you want your app's users to get a message periodically asking them to revisit lessons in topics where they don't have an "A"
 
 Loop through `averageScores` below and if an average falls between `lowAvg` and `highAvg`print "You should work on <topic> more". Otherwise, move on. (1 point)
*/
let lowAvg = 80
let highAvg = 89
var averageScores: [String: Int] = ["Algebra 1": 85, "Geometry": 93, "Algebra 2": 88, "Math Analysis": 82, "Calculus": 91, "Prob & Stats": 93]
