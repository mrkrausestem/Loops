 ## App Exercise - While Loops
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a mathematics tutoring app.
 
 You want your app to time how long your users have to take an assessment.
 
 For this exercise, you'll simulate timing of an assessment. Use a while loop to print "XX seconds has passed",3 where XX is every 10 seconds, to the console 10 times. Once you've successfully printed "XX seconds has passed" to the console 10 times, add the following code to the end of your while loop: `Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 60/cadence)` and adjust the value of cadence to put a pause between each iteration of the while loop so that the print statements actually occur at the proper cadence. (2 points)
 */
let cadence: Double = 6
var secondsPassed = 0


/*:
 Recreate the above cadence example using a repeat-while loop. (1 point)
 */
secondsPassed = 0
